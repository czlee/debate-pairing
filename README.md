Debate tournament pairing simulations
=====================================

This repository contains some scripts to simulate different methods of pairing
debate tournaments, both for two-team formats and British Parliamentary.

The scripts are written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/). The core functions
are written in Julia files, but useful demonstrations are written using
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). This allows them to be shared easily
with commentary and plots included.
